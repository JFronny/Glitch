# Glitch
A rewrite of [MEMZ](https://github.com/Leurak/MEMZ) in C#

# Features
- All original graphical payloads are implemented
- Includes original payloads (Remove the class files if you don't want that)
- Written in C#. This does make it slower but allows for more modularity

# Missing features
- The MBR payload would have to be copied from the original as C# doesn't compile to native code
- Glitch Customizer only supports a console-based interface.
